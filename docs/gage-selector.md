## **FAQ**

### **What if I don't need the longest Gage Size?**
Enter your Vessel Center-to-Center in inches in the input box marked "Vessel C-C" in S1.  Scroll down to S3 for End Connected gages or S4 for Close Hookup gages.

You should see a dropdown box labeled "Optional Override".  Each option displays a shorter gage size along with that gage size's visible glass length.  When you choose to override the default gage size, all gages in your current section (S3 or S4) will be updated.

### **How do I generate a data sheet?**
Once you have made your sizing selection you should see a variety of Level Gage model numbers available in S3 and S4.  Click the Level Gage model you are interested in.  You will be directed to the Datasheet Wizard application.  In this application you will be asked a few more questions to finalize the datasheet.  Once you have answered the questions you will be able to print your finalized datasheet.
