## **FAQ**

### **What if I don't need the largest Gage Size?**
Enter your Vessel Center-to-Center in inches in the input box marked "Vessel C-C" in S1.  Scroll down to S3 for End Connected gages or S4 for Close Hookup gages.

You should see a dropdown box labeled "Optional Override".  Each option displays a shorter gage size along with that gage size's visible glass length.  When you choose to override the default gage size, all gages in your current section (S3 or S4) will be updated.
